Build a Raytracer - Workshop by DDU India at BITS-ATMOS Hyderabad 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simplest possible raytracer written in C, with minimal usage of
pointers and external libraries, for easy understanding of the basic theory.

We did not make a makefile because it's too easy to compile:
gcc raytracer.c -lm 

Run the default executable created by gcc named as a.out as:
./a.out

Above executable will create a ppm file, to view, use ImageMagick as:
display output.ppm


Some points for performance sake:
1. Image Size: for quick testing, use something like 320x240
2. Recursion Depth: Can be kept 0 for no reflections/refractions
3. Cone and Cylinder can use smaller resolution, default image uses 32
4. Sphere resolution, unlike Cone and Cylinder, is power of 4

Thank you for downloading our code.
